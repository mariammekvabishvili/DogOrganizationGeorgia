        <h2>Our mission and the history of the founding of D.O.G.</h2>
        <p class="text">For locals and tourists alike, the sight of stray dogs wandering around is a familiar one. In Tbilisi alone, despite various dog control programs being declared, it is estimated there are tens of thousands of dogs wandering the city’s parks and streets fending for themselves, struggling to survive.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to address the many different roots of this problem; and in turn reduce the number of stray dogs, to help homeless animals and promote responsible pet ownership and animal welfare.</p>
        <p>Arriving in Georgia in 2008, Dutch businessman, Ivo Bakhuijzen was astounded at the number of stray animals lying around the streets of the capital. He was shocked to witness car after car simply driving past a semi-conscious puppy that had clearly been hit by a vehicle; when only he stopped to help the poor pup, he knew he had to do something.</p>
        <p>From that moment, Ivo decided something had to be done and he established the charitable foundation – Dog Organization Georgia (D.O.G.) to provide shelter and food for homeless animals. His goal was also to prevent unwanted and uncontrolled births of stray animals and stop their abuse together with the reported use of inhumane culling methods. After extensive fundraising and overcoming numerous obstacles, D.O.G. eventually opened Tbilisi’s first no-kill dog shelter in 2011.</p>
